                <strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;If you are a copyright owner or an
                agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your
                copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the
                Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our
                Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see
                17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
              </p>
              <p>
                – A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to
                act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
                allegedly infringed;
              </p>
              <p>
                – Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
                infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online
                site are covered by a single notification, a representative list
                of such works at that site;
              </p>
              <p>
                – Identification of the material that is claimed to be
                infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that
                is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and
                information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider
                to locate the material;
              </p>
              <p>
                – Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service
                provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number,
                and, if available, an electronic mail;
              </p>
              <p>
                – A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
                material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
                copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
              </p>
              <p>
                – A statement that the information in the notification is
                accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized
                to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
                allegedly infringed.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Our designated Copyright Agent to
                receive notifications of claimed infringement is:
                info@meddiah.com
              </p>
              <p>
                – For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright
                Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical
                support, and other communications should be directed to the
                company’s customer service. You acknowledge that if you fail to
                comply with all of the requirements of this Section 9, your DMCA
                notice may not be valid.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>If you believe that your Content that
                was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing,
                or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
                copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use
                the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice
                containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
              </p>
              <p>– Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
              <p>
                – Identification of the Content that has been removed or to
                which access has been disabled and the location at which the
                Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
              </p>
              <p>
                – A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content
                was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
                misidentification of the Content; and
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>If a counter-notice is received by the
                Copyright Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the
                original complaining party informing that person that it may
                replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business
                days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
                order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed
                Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14
                business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at
                our sole discretion.
